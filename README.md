# Human Activities & Gestures Recognition using Channel State Information (CSI) of IEEE-802.11n Devices
This is a data-set for Human Activities & Gestures Recognition (HAGR) using the Channel State information (CSI) of IEEE 802.11n devices. Our data-set will be helpful specifically for two types of researches. 

Why upload this dataset? Because there has been a lot of research work in this area very recently, and it is very difficult to compare existing work as experimental environments differ. So by creating a unique dataset, now we can compare existing works + researchers don't need to spend days collecting the data!

However, this dataset is aimed for two types of researches:

(i) For researchers or engineers in HAGR who want to utilize the CSI to make further improvements in this area,

(ii) For machine learning/ deep learning engineers as we will upload specific sections of data from which no feature selection is needed, so you can try your algorithms and compare with our results!
