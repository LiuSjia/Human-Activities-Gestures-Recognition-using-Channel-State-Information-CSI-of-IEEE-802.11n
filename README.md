# Human-Activities-Gestures-Recognition-using-Channel-State-Information-CSI-of-IEEE-802.11n
This is a data-set for Human Activities &amp; Gestures Recognition (HAGR) using the Channel State information (CSI) of IEEE 802.11n devices. Our data-set will be helpful specifically for two types of researches. (i) For researchers or engineers in HAGR who want to utilize the CSI to make further improvements in this area, (ii) For machine learning/ deep learning engineers as we will upload specific sections of data from which no feature selection is needed, so you can try your algorithms and compare with our results!
